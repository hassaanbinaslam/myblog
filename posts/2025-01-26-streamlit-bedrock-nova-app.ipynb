    "\n",
    "[Amazon's Nova Canvas](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/creative/) is a state-of-the-art Amazon foundation model that promises to democratize high-quality image generation. However, the complexities of these models can often be a barrier to entry. This post presents a practical solution: a [Streamlit-based](https://streamlit.io/) application that makes experimenting with Nova Canvas accessible to everyone. I will walk you through the features of this app, which includes five powerful tools, encompassing text-to-image generation, conditional generation, background removal, inpainting, and outpainting. You can seamlessly explore the diverse capabilities of this potent technology and bring your creative visions to life."

    "## Introducing Amazon Nova Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of my app is Amazon Nova Canvas, a latest foundation model that I'm using to generate realistic, studio-quality images from text prompts. This model is a versatile tool for both text-to-image generation and advanced image editing. Nova Canvas excels at creating images that capture the concepts described in your text prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond `text-to-image` (T2I), I'm also leveraging its image editing capabilities, which include `inpainting`, `outpainting`, generating variations, and automatic editing without masks. **Inpainting** allows you to reconstruct masked regions in an image. **Outpainting** lets you seamlessly extend an image beyond its original boundaries, and you can guide this with masks or let the model determine it. The model also supports **image conditioning**, which uses a reference image to guide generation, and it also supports subject consistency to preserve a chosen subject like a pet or a shoe in your generated images. It can also automatically `remove backgrounds` from an image, making the background transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this model provides me with a powerful and diverse set of tools to unleash creative possibilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "To make exploring the power of Amazon Nova Canvas as easy and accessible as possible, I decided to build an application using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). I chose Streamlit because it is incredibly efficient for quickly creating interactive web apps with minimal coding, making it the perfect tool for this project. My goal was to create a hands-on playground where you could directly experiment with Nova Canvas's capabilities, transforming your creative ideas into visual reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This app isn't just for tech enthusiasts; I wanted it to be user-friendly, allowing anyone to explore AI-powered image generation and editing**. The best part is that it's designed for easy sharing and deployment, so you can effortlessly share your experiments with your friends, or even deploy the app for wider access. I have included some of the app's screenshots below, so you can have a quick overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see a simple login page where you can enter your credentials (or bypass authentication during local testing). After logging in, you are presented with a user-friendly interface, with a sidebar that lets you navigate to each of the five image processing tools. The welcome page gives you a quick overview of each of the tools and how to use them. Each tool provides an intuitive interface with controls to configure the parameters and get the most out of the capabilities of the Amazon Nova Canvas model.\n",

    "## Text to Image with Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking image generation to the next level, my \"Text to Image with Condition\" tool lets you shape your creations with precision and intention. It goes beyond simple text prompts by using a reference image to guide the generation process, helping you achieve the exact look and feel you desire. This tool uses advanced image conditioning features, offering two powerful methods: Canny Edge Detection and Segmentation Maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Canny Edge Detection**: By extracting the edges from your reference image. The output will inherit the structural layout of the reference image.\n",
    "* **Segmentation Maps**: This allows you to define and control specific areas or objects in the reference image. The model will then use this information to render precise outputs and allow you to manipulate individual objects in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Use It:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, upload the reference image that you want to use to guide the generation. For best results, ensure the reference image is clear and appropriately sized.\n",
    "* Next, select the conditioning method that you want to use: Canny Edge or Segmentation Map from the \"Control Mode\" dropdown.\n",
    "* You can adjust the \"Control Strength\" parameter to determine how closely the generated image adheres to the reference image. Use a lower value to introduce more randomness in the generation.\n",
    "* Then, enter a text prompt describing the image you want to generate, keeping in mind the selected conditioning method.\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also enter a negative prompt to further refine the image.\n",
    "* Configure other options, such as the number of images, image size and the cfgScale parameter, just like you did in the Text to Image page.\n",
    "* Click on the \"Generate Image\" button to view the results. The generated images will be displayed below the button along with the original image used for conditioning.\n",

    "Below is an example of what the app looks like after generating two images using the Canny Edge option.

    "## Image Outpainting\n",
    "\n",
    "My final tool in this application is the \"Image Outpainting Tool.\" This tool lets you expand your images beyond their original boundaries, creating seamless extensions that match the original content. Whether you want to extend landscapes, complete partial scenes, or create panoramic views, this tool helps you achieve natural-looking results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Upload Image**: Start by uploading your image using the uploader. The app can handle different image formats.\n",
    "* **Select Mask Type**:\n",
    "  * **Prompt**: Use text to define the mask area to preserve. You can use a text prompt to specify what part of the image you want to keep unchanged and the model will generate a mask for you.\n",
    "  * **Image**: Automatically mask the image area to keep unchanged. The model will mask the entire image as the area to preserve.\n",
    "* **Set Expanded Size**: Choose the new image size: `512x512` or `1024x1024` using the dropdown.\n",
    "* **Adjust Position**: Use the \"Image Horizontal Position\" and \"Image Vertical Position\" controls to place your image within the expanded canvas.\n",
    "* **Add a Prompt**: Describe how the extended areas should look. Be as specific as possible to get desired results.\n",
    "* **Generate Results**: Click on the \"Edit Image\" button to create and refine your expanded image. The expanded image and the expanded image mask will be displayed below the image and controls. The output will be displayed below that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of what the app looks like after outpainting an uploaded image. Here I have used the \"Image\" mask type and the prompt \"forest setting in the background with animals and plants.\" I have kept the other options at their default value.\n",
    "\n",

This repository will be used to store your application's Docker container image. I would recommend that you use a descriptive name for your repo, such as `streamlit/bedrock-nova-app`.\n",

    "\n",
    "On your local machine, build the Docker container image and then push it to your newly created ECR. Use the commands provided by AWS for your specific account and registry. Here is an example of the commands, specific to my account. Remember that the command provided by AWS in the console is very specific to your account and you should use that only:\n",
